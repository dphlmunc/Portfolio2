                    We've all started writing our stories the moment we start living and compell ourselves to write something great.<br />

                    Wether you're teaching, creating something or want to be the best at the service you provide, we all live to convey our message of greatness. <br />
                    <br />
                    I love telling these stories through film, art, animation and designs.<br>
                    So wether you've got a sollution for a complicated issue that's hard to convey, or want to spar about how to rewrite systems and assumptions: Get in touch, <br />
                    I'm sure we're able to tell your story together.<br />

                            <p><strong>Creative Thinking Pressure-cooker</strong>
                                <br>Due to the unpredictable nature of many parts in the creative process, it's natural to feel a bit uncomfortable tackling projects that don't seem to have a clear-cut solution before.<br>
                            Since creativity is like a muscle you can exercise, I felt it necessary to adapt a serious training regimen in order to kickstart every project from muscle memory.<br><br>
                            Enter Avans Innovative Studio: A minor focused on dishing out new projects using Creative Thinking-methods every two weeks, meant for students from different backgrounds
                            to focus on their specific goals in the creative process. For me, this means growing as a creative director and project manager.<br><br>

                                <br>As one of the founding members I comfortably adapted a leading role with website development, visual design and marketing.<br>
                                After settings things up, I started using my interests and experience to develop a workshop called 'Creation & Inspiration' <br>
                                which ran over a year before I passed the reigns to a new generation of trainers.</p>

                            <p>After my internship at E-sites, I was given the opportunity to establish and direct a new creative label within Handpicked Agencies.<br>
                                Boldly-XR's main focus was delivering immersive experiences, often challenging us by needing the cutting edge of Virtual and Augmented Reality Technoolgy.<br>
                                As a partner I was mainly tasked with business development and creative direction, altough I never shunned a chance to break out my graphics tablet or dive in an editor to block some code.</p>

                                <br>Having some experience with Virtual and Augmented Reality-development, I had found an agency that was looking into ways to employ VR<br>
                            and AR in their marketing and development-services.
                            I would often create proof-of-concepts and demos to showcase the value of 360-media and immersive technology.</p>

                     <div class="h-50"></div>
                     <p>Being one of the world's biggest producers of candies like Mentos, Fruitella and Chupa Chups; Perfetti Van Melle has several factories spread all over the world, <br>
                         which introduces a few cultural challenges when it comes to training personel in safety and security measures. <br>
                         <br>
                         In order to gamify this program, I travelled to Shanghai with a crew to film their training using a Jaunt One; the world's most pristine 360-camera at the time. <br>
                         Prior to shooting, I'd prepared storyboards and callsheets to ensure we'd wrap up in just 2 days of actual filming. <br>
                         Since I'm no expert on the subject of safety and security, I'd put myself through a crash-course using the original lecture materials, exams,
                         and interviews I'd taken with Perfetti Van Melle's consultants, whom ultimately approved of the script I wrote.

                     <p>Upon returning home, I immediately started stitching and editing the footage to make it workable for the VR-app.<br>
                 While colleagues from Breese were managing the english, italian and mandarin voice acting; me and our colleagues at Sping had started development in Unity3D.<br>
                 After finishing up editing the voice-overs and releasing V1.0 of Perfetti Van Melle's VR Training, we packaged boxes I'd put together containing instructions on how to assemble and start using the Google Daydream, which were sent all over the world to help PVM's risk & safety personel improve their work right from the comfort of their homes.</p>

                        <h3>Virtual Reality Training</h3>
                        <h6>Storytelling, Gamedesign, 3D-animation, Unity3D-development</h6>
                        <div class="h-50"></div>
                        <p>Holmatro Industry approached our team inquiring if we could develop a downloadable android game that would help them create more presence during an expo in Munchen.</p>
                        <p>Rather than devoping a downloadable app, we thought of a VR experience allowing visitors to operate Holmatro's devices in a safe VR-environment. <br />
                        When the idea was greenlit, we received one of their Hydraulic Cutters modified so the shears wouldn't open, so the opening and closing would only happen in VR. <br />
                        After recreating the device as an animated 3D-model, we equipped the device with HTC Vive Trackers to position the model on exactly the same spot as the actual cutter would be,
                        allowing users to operate it realistically in VR. <br />
                        <br /><img src="img/portfolio/pvm/01.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive" /></p>
                        <h6>An in-game screenshot from the Holmatro VR Experience</h6><br />
                        <p>To illustrate the device's use, I wrote a short mission based on an actual operation where the newly-released cordless hydraulic cutter proves to be a game-changer. <br />
                        Since older designs would require the device to hook up the device to an hydraulic pump, this created a challenge for any environment that's not reachable with a vehicle carrying the pump. <br />
                        <br />We'd found an abandoned oil-rig to be the perfect playground for such a demonstration. Once the oil-rig was complete, we'd playtest different ways of entering the environment,
                        but a realistic briefing during a helicopter ride seemed to be the most fun by far.</p>
                        <br /><br /><p>Friends at Breese created an aftermovie about this installation. <br />

                        Once they'd been inspired by competition using projection-mapping at an other expo, we were hired to blow them out of the water.</p>

                        <p>In order to do so, we wanted something interesting to grab people's attention as they'd walk by: while making sure there's something to interact with that's actually valuable for every visitor.<br>
                        So we arrived at a way to immediately configure a Bruynzeel Keukens-kitchen on the spot, using a powerful projetor on a clear-white physical kitchen.<br>
                        When the configurator wasn't being used, an animation would play as a crowd-pleaser.</p>

                        <p>The Cloud tells a story of small collections of data growing into 'Big Data', visualized by the condensation of raindrops which, in time, turn into a thunderstorm of data. As people walk past the Cloud they notice the raindrops and small changes in the Cloud's lighting, until other people start joining in and contributing to an orchestra of raindrops and light.

                                <p>This studio consists of a group of students from different fields constantly working on pressure-cooker projects that don't last longer than two weeks, challenging them to rapidly ideate and prototype.</p>
                                <p>These projects are submitted by various brands and entrepeneurs that don't have the capacity or skills in-house to tackle problems or to be innovate as a business.</p>
                            <p>For me personally, this means I get to take bigger risks and think a bit further out of the box as a designer, since none of these projects require any big investments, allowing me to focus on different angles of the creative workflow, for example: acceptation and understandability by others of the proces itself.</p>

                            <h3>Roadlights fit for the digitalisation age</h3>
                            <hr>
                            <div class="h-50"></div>
                            <h4>Brief</h4>
                            <p>After meeting with Breda's municipality our team realised there was plenty of drive and good reasoning to update the city of Breda to fit the 21st century's standards.</p>
                            <p>While housing and infrastructure are relatively good, the city is missing ways to play on the same level as Rotterdam and Eindhoven in regards to digitalisation.<br>
                            A foundation for digitalisation is being laid as we speak, with streetlights outfitted with 5G-routers and getting more IoT-like sensors around the city, we are free to tackle this problem from many possible angles.</p>
                            <div class="h-50"></div>
                            <h4>Proces</h4>
                            <p>Starting off, our team focussed on recent trends in city-digitalisation. Looking at drones, IoT-developments and AI tackling lots of luxury-issues, neither the client nor the team was feeling these obvious solutions.<br>
                            Since our team is comprised of security, automation and engineering experts, we very naturally landed on the root of many of the above-mentioned issues: traffic itself.<br>
                            While many cities have their nuances regarding how busy traffic can be, it's a well-known issue the dutch roads are overpopulated with four-wheeled vehicles.<p>
                            <p>"Wouldn't it be great if Breda could be the first city without any if these issues, thanks to rethinking the way we manage traffic?" had become the question that led our vision.<br>
                            So we came up with phosphorus lighting-solutions that were more easily integrated in city-structures, controlled by sensors to detect upcoming traffic and maintaining a 'Not really a traffic light, I'm just here to suggest'-approach.<br>
                            While avoiding any strict regulations and testing. This allowed us to make many of Breda's unsafe crossroads just a bit safer, and lighting the way for the future as we do.</p>

                            <h4>Brief</h4>
                            <p>A chocolatier from a coastal town had requested our help in order to put Hellevoetsluis on the map, using chocolat.<br>
                            'All About Chocolat' isn't afraid to take risks. Starting a business as a couple in a kitchen built in an attic, right as they entered parenthood, they've still managed to build a finely reputed chocolatier in a picturesque town.
                            Aside from the classic bonbons, the owners have a knack for creating chocolat sculptures which they put on sale. In order to help them flourish creatively, we knew we'd have to make something that's easily-produced yet striking enough to be memorable.</p>
                            <div class="h-50"></div>
                            <h4>Proces</h4>
                            <p>As soon as we could, we went to visit Hellevoetsluis and the chocolat-store hoping we'd find some interesting connections with the town or some history to build on.
                            A maritime-theme was something we landed on soon as it's hard to ignore the yachts, docks an it's history as a stronghold during the world wars.<br>
                            After reviewing the pictures I'd taken we noticed the cannon-placements were still intact, now serving to decorate the dunes. Several concepts using exploding chocolate tubes and pop-rock fillings later, I suggested we'd try a less functional approach to connecting the cannons, but rather through storytelling.</p>
                            <p>Altough at first this suggestion wasn't taken in favor by the team, as chocolat certainly needs to be "functional" in ways that it doesn't melt and can be molded into handy shapes.
                            However, a detour back to the drawingboard had led us to a simple yet interesting concept: cannonballs, round bonbons with a metallic hue and texture, held together with chocolat-bars shaped like cannonballcarriers to make packaging and serving easy yet interesting.<br>
                            For the chocolat carriers I designed a 3D-model which I printed and then translated to a plastic cast suitable for chocolat.
                            After getting our hands on some pre-made chocolat shells, we borrowed our client's chocolat workshop to test flavors that would match the concept.<p>

                            <p>In the end our client seemed to be very satisfied with the extent we'd went through to look at every aspect -including taste, which was a first for me- of the project and respecting the chocolat as a main-component.</p>

                            <hr>
                            <div class="h-50"></div>
                            <h4>Brief</h4>
                            <p>The client for this project had designed a pavilion to illustrate contact-heat as a viable way for staying comfortable. By demo'ing this, they were able to show how wasteful terrace-heaters can be, when a more subtle but well-engineered heating solution can accomplish the same for less.<br>
                            However, this demo-piece had seen it's prime while never making the impact it was intended to make.<br>
                            Our mission: Re-ignite the topic and find a way to turn the spotlights back on pavilion.</p>
                            <h4>Proces</h4>
                            <p>Thanks to it's conservative roots we were able to experiment with different kinds of green trends and technologies, such as aquaponic systems and floating farms.<br>
                            In order to make the most of two weeks of market-research our team knew they'd have to force-fit the pavilion's story in something that's already trending.<br>
                            So we wrote up and tested several prototypes in which the heating-technology, floating architecture and aquaponics would be integrated. This allowed us to look at the customer's journey from every point in order to look for a valuable connection.<br>
                            However, the pavilion had already cost more than budget allowed and shouldn't cost more than it already has without finding some audience.</p>
                            <p>Focussing on ways to pull big crowds, we landed on the idea to design a foodfestival where environmental awareness would be related to stories of farmers, store-owners and cooks in order to inspire a green attitude towards food and gastromony, while creating a stage for both the pavilion and our client's story.</p>
                            <p>Using Virtual Reality, I'd made a mock-up for the general idea and location to give our client a sensation of how it'd feel to be surrounded by environmentaly aware businesses such as hers.</p>

                            <h1>GGZ Intranet</h1>
                            <h3>A gamified way to work</h3>
                            <hr>
                            <div class="h-50"></div>
                            <h4>Brief</h4>
                            <p>As one of the biggest companies in psychological healthcare in Noord-Brabant, GGZ had commissioned the development of a new Intranet.
                                Because they were worried about low acceptation rates amongst employees, they'd look towards us to think of new ways to make the use of the new intranet more enjoyable while promoting personal growth and good work ethics.

                                The foundation we'd start with would be a beta-staged version of the Intranet and a persona that was already implemented: Tilda (Tilburg and Breda combined). This means our solution would have to co-exist or improve Tilda in some way.
                            </p>
                            <div class="h-50"></div>
                            <h4>Proces</h4>
                            <p>Since the target group consists of GGZ's employees, who are spread around the province and often out-of-office to do their work, we were facing some challenges like finding common grounds for a diverse group of employees that also catered to their mobile style of work.

                                We started looking for methods to connect the employees by interviewing professionals in the same field, leading us to a common value found in healthy and stable work-ethics.
                                Which in hindsight isn't too far-fetched, as they're advocates of mental health to their patients, they all find it important knowing their work won't take a personal toll on them as well.

                                This led us to start thinking of ways Tilda could help GGZ's employees do their work more healthily, or at least to automate some processes to relieve them of lengthy interactions with the intranet and their tasks.
                                </p>
                            <p>With these goals,
                               we'd come up with several new Assistant-like functions Tilda would be able to accomplish and a system to help illustrate the "health" of an individual or a group.
                                After having been prompted to take a <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test">Myers Briggs' personality-test</a>, Tilda would award you with a plant that corresponds to one of the 16 personalities on Myers Briggs' diagram, Explorers for example receive exotic plants like a Neptune Flytrap while Sentinels get plants that endure harsh environments or live on small amounts of water like Cacti.
                                By associating a co-worker with their plant, we've created a subtle reminder that helps them keeping their strengths and weaknesses in mind.
                                At first, we thought of Tamagotchi-like avatars, but found plants to be more subtle, pleasant and most importantly: to illustrate (team)growth better.
                                The growth system of a plant is linked to several key-points of an employees work and everyday life. For example, you'd gain points every time you use a carpool, or for checking in at the gym and taking a lunchbreak-walk, but also for correctly logging your work and organizing workshops or events.
                                When teams are formed, Tilda would repot the plants to put them together to illustrate a team's effectiveness. This way we can better gauge the effectiveness and happiness of a team.<p>

                            <div class="h-50"></div>
                            <h4>Results</h4>
                            <p>The idea of Tilda turning into a more intelligent assistant was adapted amongst other studio-projects as well, and GGZ's development team recognized there are a lot of chances to be had in that field.
                                They were especially surprised about the psychological value of the way we iconified personalities and linked that with the actual work they do, instead of it being something separate and time-consuming.
                                Putting more effort into improving your employees' quality of life has been a proven recipe to guarantee a team's success, so we were very glad to see eye-to-eye with our client on this.

                            <h4>Brief</h4>
                            After the fusion of AOC and Aliancys, the company started focussing more on sustainability and innovations, hence their participation in the SMC-BMC competition for Composite Innovation.

                            We were invited to partake on their behalf in order to provide a "clean" look on the composites and their uses, to think outside the carbon-fiber box, as they say.
                            The theme for this year's competition was "Moving to the Future" aiming towards solutions for mobility and infrastructure.
                            After bringing us up to speed on the contest itself, we received a one-day crash course on the production, impact and current uses of their composite materials (fiber and carbon resins).

                            <div class="h-50"></div>
                            <h4>Proces</h4>
                            Since the theme's definition is still very broad, we started thinking of objects we regularly use, to discover challenges in portability and mobility.
                            After we'd first settled on a vehicle that would combine electric motors used by a Renault Twizy-like machine and an electric scooter integrated into the vehicle; we realized this would take too many partnerships and outsourcing to make it feasible.

                            After returning from the drawing table (or actually, mainly just gauging mobility-needs amongst peers) we ran into a problem we thought was very recognizable to ourselves as well.
                            As we mature throughout our lives, we go through phases of bags and other containers for us to carry our "Everyday Carry".
                            These bags and suitcases are representatives of our personality and reflect our style, the work we do and of course: what we like to carry.
                            Take me for example, I carry a Kickstarted sling/back-pack from Sweden mainly, while I usually have another duffle bag for gym equipment, an older laptop-bag for additional gadgets and gear, and often even a plastic shopping bag to carry my lunch with. These are all used together without any mind for consistency or efficiency, that's how I sometimes manage to easily lose small parts like tripods and camera-accessories.

                            So wouldn't it be great if there was a one-stop solution for almost all of your carrying-needs?
                            Most people would think of trecking-gear, with those huge backpacks that fit a sleeping bag, but you can hardly walk into a meeting wearing those.
                            That's why we started focussing on students who're transitioning towards professionals since that's an important turning point for most people's carrying and mobility-needs: Your rhythm changes thanks to new jobs, living arrangements, and relations. Their morals change as well, so they'll either want a more premium and luxury item they're willing to pay for so they won't have to replace it soon, or they'll choose the option of changing them a lot so they can mix-and-match.

                            With those values in mind, we tried to think of a case that would fit both needs, and came up with a modular briefcase using a composite material that would flex on one side, but remain rigid and stiff on the other; to withstand impact but still being able to flex where needed.

                            The material would be made using a mold for Epoxy resins, resulting in small triangles individually placed on a piece of canvas or leather to provide a watertight connection.
                            We also looked at the Spyderslide-system to easily attach and detach modular cases to the briefcase, enabling the user to quickly clip on a bathroom-case or shoe-case for a last-minute flight.

                            <h4>Results</h4>
                            As entries are still open until June 30th, we haven't yet seen any results of other competitors or received any final judgment from a jury. We have, however, gotten some feedback from AOC BMC who were very enthusiastic about the modularity and how it resulted in more recyclability options.
                            While they thought the market might not be ready for an item with this kind of overpowered durability (the estimated life-expectancy of the case is around 8 years), they liked how we were able to think outside that box by reimagining such an everyday object.

                            <h1>Mastroianni's Bed & Bistro</h1>
                            <h3>Seduced by art and artistic meals</h3>
                            <hr>
                            <div class="h-50"></div>
                            <h4>Brief</h4>
                            When I caught wind that Mastroianni's chef was an apprentice of Massimo's, of whom I'm a great fan, I immediately knew I wanted to assemble a team that could appreciate the intricacy and beauty of their recipes.
                            After meeting with mr. Mastroianni's himself, I was delighted yet unsurprised we gauged a high interest for cultures and art, as their main mission was not to become Italy's finest haute cuisine, but rather: a provider of grand cultural experiences through a food-journey.

                            With that in mind, we were asked to find ways to attract international tourists to the restaurant despite Mastroianni's location not being ideal for tourists that stick to the city center.

                            <div class="h-50"></div>
                            <h4>Proces</h4>
                            Due to the focus on international attraction, Simon and I looked for culturally diverse members of our group to double as experts on their home-cuisine and to see if the Italian cuisine leaves any chances to be met on this front.
                            After a team was assembled, we immediately started looking for ways to address the Italian tourists and quickly realized Parma (where Mastroianni's is located) was going to be 2020's Cultural Capital, meaning there will be a huge emphasis to drive their cultural strength.
                            We'd found this to be a perfect angle. Thanks to this timing, we'd also have half a year to realize almost any idea we'd come up with.

                            The first few days we'd spent prototyping ways to connect the art-scene with the international food-scene, but soon felt we were trying something that was missing its goal no matter the number of ideas we shot. Probably because we couldn't create "great art" in the time we'd spent on every individual prototype, so we looked for more suitable candidates to create the art and found the Parma University of Arts to house a lot of hungry artists looking for exposition-space.

                            This led us to rethink our concept to focus on engaging with artists and letting them create the "advertisement" for Mastroianni's.
                            We don't want the restaurant to simply commission food-art for their restaurant, but rather: invest in exposition-space using Mastroianni's connections and resources, namely around the city center.
                            In this manner, we uphold the creative freedom of artists while supplying them with the exposure they deserve, while putting Mastroianni's name on the map as one of Parma's greatest art patrons, much like the way the Medici Bank gained its fame.

                            That doesn't mean we went and sat back into our chairs after drawing up some guidelines for the artists. Rather we started thinking of the whole customer journey whenever a tourist would find a piece of art in a storefront or public area and started designing information-signs and looking for good spots to reserve in 2020.

                            <h4>Results</h4>
                            <p>In the end, we presented a plan to communicate these exposition-opportunities to students and local artists while giving a sense of how this would influence the city and Mastroianni's image.
                            Unfortunately, our client's Dutch representative was much more interested in having a clear business-case rather than an innovative and community-focussed method of changing a company's image, which I can understand when your role in a particular business is driven by numbers about efficiency and profit.
                            I do strongly believe we have to stop relying on such perspectives and dare to be bold to deliver true value to your customers and your community.

                            <h4>Reflection</h4>
                            <p>As of the 14th of June, I've concluded this adventure with some amazing and creative people who've taught me more about myself and the way I conduct myself in a group more than any school or community has before.<br>
                            Although my focus was on learning how to become a better project manager by leading groups to succesful concepts, I feel like the bigger project in this scenario was me, and I've undergone more management than I was able to do by myself.<br>
                            As a designer I've always been taught to never prioritize your own views over the users. Having students around who were completely new to this proces, yet driving this home so well, felt like a mirror held and pointed towards me.<p>
                                    What I've come to realize is that I can't help people find their creative strengths without leveling with them first and truly listening to them. I thought I did, but I've encountered several moments where I prioritized efficiency over the growth and health of myself and my team, which should always be the number one.
                                    <br>The one thing that resonated through all my past teammates after working with me for two weeks was the impression I'd hold their hands too often, even when they needed the space to discover things themselves.<br>
                                    However, most are also grateful I persisted and acknowledged my reasonings for it. Because it's not like I don't want them to succeed in their own way, I'm afraid to see people settle for half-assed solutions or bad practises when trying to solve problems.</p>
                                <br>
                                    <h4>Moving forward</h4>
                                    That's why, instead of realizing my initial goals for project management, <br>
                                    I've decided to become a Sustainability Designer, with a mission to become an architect for good and healthy practices in design and education.<br></p>
                                <p>To start this journey, I'm doing my thesis on designing a sustainable alternative to both leather and plastic: bacteria-grown Kombucha-fabric.</p><br>
                            <p>But for now, I'd like to like to illustrate my goals and growth in the same fashion I quantified the results of my past projects:</p>
